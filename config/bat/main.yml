# --- IMPORTANT:
#     Many packages and plugins use `bat` under the hood. Changing the bat
#     theme affects all those packages and plugins.
#
#     You can customize the bat theme with a config file or with an environment
#     variable. See:
#       https://github.com/sharkdp/bat?tab=readme-ov-file#highlighting-theme
#       https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim/issues/23#issuecomment-1636639722
#
#     Apparently the config file works for bat itself but not for the other
#     packages or Neovim plugins. The environment variable does work for all.
#     Check the `exports` zsh config file.
