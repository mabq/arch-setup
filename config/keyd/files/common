# --- Notes:
#     DO NOT APPEND COMMENTS, PUT THEM IN THEIR OWN LINES.
#
#     These configurations apply to all keyboards.
#
#     Included files should not contain an [ids] section.
#     Included files should not end in `.conf`.
#     Included files should include other files.
#
#     Use:
#     - `keyd monitor` to check key names
#     - `sudo systemd enable/start keyd.service` to enable/start the service
#     - `sudo keyd reload` to update changes on config files
#     - `sudo journalctl -eu keyd` to check for error after update, the output
#       will also show the keyboard names and the configuration file applied.
