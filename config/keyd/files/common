# 1) Edit normal layers:

[main]

# space = overload(meta, space)
capslock = layer(control)
enter = overload(control, enter)
f = overload(nav, f)
; = overload(symbols, ;)
' = overload(media, ')
[ = -
# (is this what is causing keyboard layouts switch?)
#shift = oneshot(shift)


[shift]
# (make sure pressing both shifts work, required for accents)
# (see hyprland input variables)
rightshift = macro(leftshift+rightshift)
leftshift = macro(leftshift+rightshift)


# 2) Custom layers:

[nav]

# --- top row
i = esc
o = backspace
[ = +
# --- home row
h = left
j = down
k = up
l = right
; = ~
' = `
shift = capslock
d = layer(nav2)
# --- bottom row
n = enter
m = tab
, = [
. = ]
/ = \


# [nav:M]
# --- disable overload for key repetition
# space = space


[nav2]
# --- top row
i = f2
o = delete
p = macro(C-S-v)
# --- home row
h = home
j = pagedown
k = pageup
l = end
# --- bottom row
# , = macro(C-S-tab)
# . = macro(C-tab)


[symbols]
# --- top row
q = !
w = @
e = #
r = $
t = %
# --- home row
capslock = ^
a = (
s = )
d = {
f = }
g = =
# --- bottom row
v = |
b = &


[media]
s = previoussong
