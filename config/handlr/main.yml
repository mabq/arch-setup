    # Default application information is stored in `~/.config/mimeapps.list`.
    #
    # In order to define a default application you need to associate a file
    # extension or mime type to a desktop entry.
    #
    # `handlr` is a tool that helps you manage the `mimeapps.list`, e.g:
    #
    #   - `handlr set '.png' nsxiv.desktop`         # extension
    #   - `handlr set 'image/png' nsxiv.desktop`    # mime type
    #   - `handlr set 'image/*' nsxiv.desktop`      # all images
    #
    # ðŸ”¥ `handlr` has autocomplete for both, file extensions (or mime types) and
    # available desktop entries on your system.
    #
    # See `https://github.com/chmln/handlr#usage` or use `handlr --help` for
    # usage instructions.
    #
    # Yazi is configured to use `handlr` to open files.
    #
    # Unlike other configuration files, the mimeapps.list will change
    # when using the handlr command, not necessarily manually changing
    # the file.
